# White2Updates
Code Injection Patches to upgrade the White 2 gameplay experience while making a ROM Hack
These are the compliled patches, do NOT combine them with the patches in this repository outside of the ``Compiled Patches`` folder

## Patches
### Hard Level Caps
  - Limits the maximum level a pokemon can be (doesn't affect Rare Candy, use the Rare Candy Level Caps patch to add this feature)
  - Set the game variable 16415 to the level cap you want using CTRMap or some other editor, use the command WorkSet (```EventWorks.Set(16415, levelcap)```) from a script to acomplish that
  - If you are already using the variable 16415 you can change it modifying the ```LEVEL_CAP_VAR``` definition to the value you want, and compiling and installing the new patch
### Dynamic Speed
  - Instead of calculating action order at the begining of every turn, the game updates it depending on the most actualized speed stats and priority
  - Fully functional with speed/priority items and the moves After You and Quash
  - I've tested several scenearios and they all work fine, if you find a bug or a missing feature let me know :)

## How to Install
  - Install [CTRMap-Community Edition](https://github.com/kingdom-of-ds-hacking/CTRMap-CE) as well as the [CTRMapV](https://github.com/kingdom-of-ds-hacking/CTRMapV) plugin
  - Install the CTRMapV plugin (without it you won't be able to open a Pokemon White 2 ROM)
  - Create an extracted folder of the contents of your ROM, then create a new project
  - Download [PMC](https://github.com/kingdom-of-ds-hacking/PMC), go to the extras tab of CTRMap and click *Install/Update PMC* (You only need to do this the first time you create a new project)
  - Make sure there is a `patches` directory at *vfs/data/patches*, if there isn't create one and move there the latest [NitroKernel.dll file](https://github.com/HelloOO7/NitroKernel/releases).
  - Move the .dll files of the patches you want to install inside the patches folder, and export the ROM with CTRMap
  - If the patch requires any other modification like changing a narc or text editing it will be covered in the notes of the patch

## Compatibility
All these compiled patches are independent and compatible with each other, you can combine them as you wish

## Compiling the code
Follow this [guide](https://ds-pokemon-hacking.github.io/docs/generation-v/guides/b2w2-code_injection_set_up/)
I heard that the guy who made it is pretty handsome
